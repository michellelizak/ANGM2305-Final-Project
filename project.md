# Space Invasion

## Repository
<https://github.com/michellelizak/ANGM2305-Final-Project>

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it is relevant to media and digital arts.

## Features
- Feature 1: Player and Laser
	- Player will shoot lasers in an attempt to kill all of the aliens. I would create a player class which would be defined using the Pygame library. The player's position, speed, and horizontal constraint would be initialized, and the class includes methods for handling player input and shooting lasers.

- Feature 2: Aliens
	- Pixel aliens will move across the screen in a unique pattern. I would do this by making an Alien class that initializes an alien sprite with a specified color, position, and point value, and would create another class that allows the sprite to move from left to right

- Feature N: Kill and Win Screen
	- A kill screen and win screen will be displayed and player health and score will be kept track of. The code would keep track of the score in my main function by incrementing it when player lasers hit aliens or extra elements. The victory message would be drawn on the screen during the game loop when the condition for winning is met.

## Challenges
- Determine how to make complex custom pixel artwork of characters (different from the video provided)
- Determine how to animate the “You Win!” and “Game Over” game text
- Determine how to make the aliens respawn for an additional challenge to the player

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Create a functioning space invasion game with characters designed by me, aliens that can respawn, and animated “You Win!” and “Game Over!” text.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
-Create a functioning space invasion game with animated aliens, a player that can move across the screen and shoot lasers at the aliens, and a “You Win!”/”Game Over” screen.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create player and laser mechanism
  2. Create obstacles

- Week 2
  1. Create aliens
  2. Determine how to create respawn mechanism

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create score system
  2. Create victory/loss screen and animate

I will be using the video “Creating Space Invaders in Pygame/Python” by Clear Code on Youtube as a base, which I linked below.
